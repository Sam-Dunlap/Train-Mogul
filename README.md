# Train Mogul

Have you ever wanted to buy up all the railroads in the U.S, forcing your friends and family to pay exorbitant prices to use them while making free cross-country trips yourself? If so, Train Mogul might be the game for you.

Train Mogul is a game in which the object is to collect money for sending your train from one city to another. Once your wallet is fat enough you can return to your home city and claim victory. A full rules glossary and tutorials will be available in the final product.

## Usage

Train Mogul is not particularly useful at the moment, but in its final form it will be a free and open source game available to play locally, against computer opponents, or through networked multiplayer. Train Mogul can be played by 3-6 players. Estimated playtime is 90-120 minutes per game, so there will be options to save progress and return to the game later.

## Installation

This is a work in progress, and as such I have not included an executable file to easily run the game. If you would like to download the source code and test the project, you can do so.

In order to test the project, you will need to download [Godot](https://godotengine.org), then download this repository and open it from the Godot editor. You can then use F5 to run a debug version of the game.

If you are interested in this project or any others I am working on, feel free to email me at sdunlapwebdev@gmail.com.
